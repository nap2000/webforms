[Smap Webforms](http://www.smap.com.au) 
======

Webforms is a fork of Enketo Smart Paper (https://enketo.org) that is being reworked to implement forms in HTML5 browsers that are being managed in a Smap Server.

Follow the latest news about Smap on our [blog](http://blog.smap.com.au) and on twitter [@dgmsot](https://twitter.com/dgmsot).

Webforms is not intended to maintain any alignment with Enketo Smart Paper and will be progressively re-written.  However it uses forks of sub projects that we will contribute to:
* [Enketo Core](https://github.com/nap2000/enketo-core) which we contribute back to the Enketo community.
* [Enketo XSLT](https://github.com/MartijnR/enketo-xslt) - used inside this repo

Browser support
---------------
* IE is only supported from version 10 onwards (older versions do not support the required technologies). For performance reasons, we cannot recommend this browser though (it has no native XPath Evaluator)
* Chrome, Firefox, Safari for both desktop and mobile devices are supported. Chrome is recommended at the moment.
